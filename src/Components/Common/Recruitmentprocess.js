                Most of the recruiting organizations adopt the following standard campus recruitment process for selection of students at every stage:

Pre-Placement Talk: HR Head of the organization will explain the company’s profile and growth of the organization, selection criteria, CTC offered by them, and future prospects for students. This is an interactive platform where students may get their doubts clarified from the campus recruitment team.

Written Test (Online / Offline): This consists of (a) aptitude skills test (quantitative, verbal ability and logical reasoning), (b) computer programming test and (c) core subject knowledge test.

Group Discussion: In this round, students will be given a particular topic to discuss. At this stage, the students will be assessed traits of team spirit, reasoning ability, leadership quality, flexibility, initiative, assertiveness and awareness.

Interview by Technical Experts: After short listing in GD, the students will be further interviewed in the core subject knowledge covering fundamental concepts and practical application by technical experts.

Final Interview by HR Experts: This is the final stage of selection process wherein, student’s positive attitude along with communication skills, confidence level and goal setting will be assessed by HR experts.
